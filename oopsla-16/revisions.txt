==== mandatory ====

[ ] Acknowledge seqcst assumption ("explain why assumption is reasonable")
	"Future work could extend our implementation and proofs using the techniques in [Zhang PLDI15]."

[ ] Pure HB vs limited HB

[ ] Explain more precisely how you choose new preemption points to add. ("algorithm 0")

[ ] Related work (huang PLDI15 and fasttrack/chess)

[ ] "philosophical difference about data races versus concrete failures"
	[ ] be more explicit in narrative
	[ ] Include the number of data races in the experimental results in addition to bugs found.

==== promised but optional ====

[ ] Add ICB bound statistics on bugs found

[ ] add future work: complete bigger jobs first sometimes, to prune smaller ones
	(prob just for maximal state space)

[ ] Figure 2 needs work

[ ] Work on formalism/definitions
