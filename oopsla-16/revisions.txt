==== optional ====

[x] add future work: complete bigger jobs first sometimes, to prune smaller ones
	(prob just for maximal state space)

[ ] Figure 2 needs work

[ ] Work on formalism/definitions

[ ] figure 9 make an alternate version for pure hb candidates (need run new tests probably)

[ ] fix totalverifs dataset for DPOR/ICB because purehb verif might add more ctrl-totalverif grupos

==== mandatory ====

[x] Acknowledge seqcst assumption ("explain why assumption is reasonable")
	"Future work could extend our implementation and proofs using the techniques in [Zhang PLDI15]."

[x] change prose regarding sssmc shared mem

[x] Pure HB vs limited HB
	[x] rename QS DR to QS LHB / QS PHB
	[x] add an 'evaluation question' "How does hb approach compare"
	[x] general narrative changes


[x] Explain more precisely how you choose new preemption points to add. ("algorithm 0")
	[x] refactor prose in section 3
	[x] write naive approach paragraph
	[x] write algorithm 2 (nee: "algorithm 0")

[x] Related work (huang PLDI15 and fasttrack/chess)
	[x] fasttrack:
		say we implement djit+
		say why fasttrack alg is not appropriate, it reports only the first write/write(?) race (check this)
	[x] chess
		remove 'factually incorrect' claim
		spend more time in intro introducing the SSSMC-Shared-Mem approach which Inspect does and which is possible with chess
	[x] pct
		improve discussion somehow...

[ ] "philosophical difference about data races versus concrete failures"
	[x] be more explicit in narrative
		[x] describe in intro/bgnd
		[x] describe in eval
	[x] Include the number of data races in the experimental results in addition to bugs found.
		[x] fix the stupid table
			left side
				[x] fix count of ICB bugs etc.
				[x] put new columns of bug counts for new expts
				[x] fix "avg tested sses" to be for icb timeouts, not dpor
			right side
				[x] split right side into individual section
				[x] get correct numbers for total/benign/untested DRs under pure hb

==== promised ====

[x] Add ICB bound statistics on bugs found

[x] "citations take up too much space" remove isbn/url/doi etc

[x] reviewer D comments
	[x] You are seriously glossing over the fact that you are ignoring weak memory models.
		Just say: we assume sequentially consistent hardware, the rest is future work, or something like that (In intro)
	[x] characterization of HB vs. Limited HB is highly misleading
		clarify advantage of limited hb
	[x] brief mention of why can't hack allocator to never reuse memory
