==== mandatory ====

[ ] Acknowledge seqcst assumption ("explain why assumption is reasonable")
	"Future work could extend our implementation and proofs using the techniques in [Zhang PLDI15]."

[ ] Pure HB vs limited HB

[x] Explain more precisely how you choose new preemption points to add. ("algorithm 0")
	[x] refactor prose in section 3
	[x] write naive approach paragraph
	[x] write algorithm 2 (nee: "algorithm 0")

[ ] Related work (huang PLDI15 and fasttrack/chess)
	fasttrack:
		say we implement djit+
		say why fasttrack alg is not appropriate, it reports only the first write/write(?) race (check this)
	chess
		remove 'factually incorrect' claim
		spend more time in intro introducing the SSSMC-Shared-Mem approach which Inspect does and which is possible with chess
	pct
		improve discussion somehow...

[ ] "philosophical difference about data races versus concrete failures"
	[ ] be more explicit in narrative
	[ ] Include the number of data races in the experimental results in addition to bugs found.

==== promised ====

[ ] Add ICB bound statistics on bugs found

[ ] "citations take up too much space" remove isbn/url/doi etc

[ ] reviewer D comments
	You are seriously glossing over the fact that you are ignoring weak memory models.
		Just say: we assume sequentially consistent hardware, the rest is future work, or something like that (In intro)
	characterization of HB vs. Limited HB is highly misleading
		clarify advantage of limited hb
	brief mention of why can't hack allocator to never reuse memory

==== optional ====

[ ] add future work: complete bigger jobs first sometimes, to prune smaller ones
	(prob just for maximal state space)

[ ] Figure 2 needs work

[ ] Work on formalism/definitions
