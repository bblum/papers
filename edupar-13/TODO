== Trim? (ordered by ease & unimportance) ==

- DPOR sentence and citation
- Data race justification paragraph (and tsan citation)
- I guess we could not cite dBug or demeter
- Landslide-friendly test characteristics
- Write 410 limitations section in fewer sentences
- The 410 system call table if *absolutely necessary*
