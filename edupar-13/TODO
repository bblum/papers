Ben is very unhappy with "vanish()".

[Dave] parse Garth's PDF files

[Dave] I don't think that's the right Plan 9 citation.

Dave:
I note in the SMP section I mentioned the BKL option but we never
mention it again. Is there an easy number we could say in the results
section for how many students handed in BKL solutions?

Dave:
I'm confused by your comment about vanish/exit. It's fine to use the
change you made there, but we do need to say *somewhere* what vanish
means. We first mention it in section 2-A-4 and the current version
will confuse people.

[???] Boot kernels on real hardware?
[Dave] in grading section, could say something about where students typically "lose points"

== Trim? (ordered by ease & unimportance) ==

- Hurdle criteria section is now too long
- Data race justification paragraph (and tsan citation)
- Landslide-friendly test characteristics
- Write 410 limitations section in fewer sentences
- The 410 system call table if *absolutely necessary*
