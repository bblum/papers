\begin{abstract}

In \carnegiemellon's undergraduate operating systems course
students learn how to write correct and principled concurrent code through
a series of low-level programming projects.
The curriculum includes implementing hardware device drivers and a user-level
threading library, and culminates in a six-week long project in which students
build from the ground up a fully-preemptible, UNIX-like kernel that can run
on real hardware.

We aspire to expand the scope of these projects in response to
typical hardware platforms'
increasing complexity,
especially massive multi-core.
To that end, we wish to reduce the time students spend
debugging concurrency bugs.
We present Landslide, a
%systematic testing
stateless model checker which
offers a more principled approach than stress testing.

%\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\section{Future Work}

We are presently extending \landslide to support Pintos kernels \cite{pintos},
%used at many top CS schools including Stanford, Berkeley, and University of Chica
another instructional kernel popular at many top CS schools.
%a more widely-used instructional kernel than \pebbles.
Because Pintos mandates more internal APIs than \pebbles,
\landslide can more easily instrument student code without requiring manual annotations.
In a preliminary experiment, we tested 79 student Pintos implementations with \landslide,
finding 59 concurrency bugs with 10 CPU-hours allocated to each of 3 test cases \cite{quicksand-anonymized}.
In future work, we hope to fully automate Pintos instrumentation, and offer \landslide at other schools beyond \cmu.
