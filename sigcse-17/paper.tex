\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

In \carnegiemellon's undergraduate operating systems course
students learn how to write correct and principled concurrent code through
a series of low-level programming projects.
The curriculum includes implementing hardware device drivers and a user-level
threading library, and culminates in a six-week long project in which students
build from the ground up a fully-preemptible, UNIX-like kernel that can run
on real hardware.

We aspire to expand the scope of these projects in response to
typical hardware platforms'
increasing complexity,
especially massive multi-core.
To that end, we wish to reduce the time students spend
debugging concurrency bugs.
We present Landslide, a
%systematic testing
stateless model checker which
offers a more principled approach than stress testing.
% edupar version
%We report on our preliminary experience working with students using Landslide to find previously-overlooked bugs in their own code, and discuss future methods for making Landslide more accessible to struggling students.
% sigcse version
We report on our experience giving students Landslide during the thread library
%and kernel projects.
project,
%Although kernel-mode Landslide requires manual instrumentation, testing thread libraries is fully automatic.
% TODO: verify these, obv. ;)
showing that it allows them to find and fix previously-overlooked bugs.
Further, %even struggling students can take advantage of it,
Landslide's users achieve higher concurrency scores on average in subsequent projects,
% FIXME awkward phrasing
suggesting that debugging with a model checker improves student retention of concurrency principles.
