\title{Soundness Proofs for Iterative Deepening}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In our paper we show the effectiveness of combining dynamic data-race detection \cite{eraser,hybriddatarace} with stateless model checking \cite{verisoft,dpor}.
Our approach involves adding new state spaces to explore each time a new data-race candidate is found.
This document presents two proofs concerning the technique.

First, we prove that given enough time, Iterative Deepening will converge to the same degree of schedule coverage that would be provided by a na\"{i}ve MC preempting on every single instruction.
In other words, when Iterative Deepening finishes generating new data-race PPs, and completes all associated state spaces,
it serves as a full verification of {\em all possible} thread schedules of the given test case.

Second, we prove the soundness of the {\em malloc-recycle} false-positive-elimination tactic we discuss in the paper.
Despite many powerful reduction techniques, the state spaces are still exponentially sized,
so any way to avoid exploring some in advance is obviously beneficial.
We prove that for the special case of {\em malloc-recycle} false positives, it is safe to eliminate these immediately upon discovering them, without bothering to explore their associated state spaces.


This document is supplemental material to our main paper; we assume the reader is already familiar with our motivation and terminology.

% TODO
% We suspect that DPOR + pure-HB will always eventually find all data races uncovered by MHB.
% for the purpose of iterative deepening, MHB is
% better because it will find the data races much sooner, rather than requiring you
% to explore the maximal state space before the race can be uncovered
