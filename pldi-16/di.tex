\section{Design}

TODO

Unlike in chess AI, however, adding more preemption points to a completed state space is not necessarily a linear process, as  % blah blah multiple combinations

% define minimal state space and maximal state space

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Implementation}

Landslide provides estimated completion time using the Recursive Estimator algorithm in \cite{estimation}.

% TODO: Talk about the multiple ways DR PPs are added (alone / in addition)

% TODO: make sure to talk about avoiding thrashing
\subsection{Avoiding thrashing in \quicksand}

(Here the reviewers will wonder if the whole point of the paper was just to build up to that one joke.)
