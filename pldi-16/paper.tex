\title{Stateless Model Checking with Data-Race Preemption Points}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Stateless model checking is a promising technique for testing concurrent programs,
but is vulnerable to exponential explosion of the state space when the test input parameters are too large.
Several partial-order reduction techniques exist for mitigating this explosion,
but even after pruning equivalent interleavings, the state space size for a fixed set of preemption points is unpredictable and often intractable.
%
Data race detection, another concurrency testing approach, focuses on identifying suspicious memory access pairs during a single test execution.
It avoids concerns of intractable state space size, but suffers from a high rate of false positives.

We present an {\em Iterative Deepening} framework for stateless model checking,
which manages the exploration of many state spaces using different subsets of preemption points.
It uses state space estimation to prioritize jobs most likely to complete in a fixed CPU budget,
and it incorporates a data-race analysis to dynamically add new preemption points to verify each data race as buggy or benign.
%
Our evaluation shows this technique is
more effective than single-state-space model checking, both at finding more bugs and at completing more state spaces when no bug exists.
