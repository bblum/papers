\title{Stateless Model Checking with Data-Race Preemption Points}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Stateless model checking is a powerful technique for testing concurrent programs,
but suffers from exponential state space explosion when the test input parameters are too large.
Several reduction techniques can mitigate this explosion,
but even after pruning equivalent interleavings, the state space size
%for a fixed set of preemption points
is often intractable.
Prior tools are limited to preempting only on synchronization APIs,
which reduces the space further, but can miss unsynchronized thread communication bugs.
%
Data race detection, another concurrency testing approach, focuses on suspicious memory access pairs during a single test execution.
It avoids concerns of state space size, but is prone to false positives.

We present an {\em Iterative Deepening} framework for stateless model checking,
which manages the exploration of many state spaces using different preemption points.
It uses state space estimation to prioritize jobs most likely to complete in a fixed CPU budget,
and it incorporates data-race analysis to add new preemption points on the fly.
Preempting threads during a data race's instructions
%These preemption points allow us to check whether each data-race can produce an observable failure, and
can automatically classify the race as buggy or benign,
and uncovers new bugs not reachable by prior model checkers.
%
It also enables full verification of all possible schedules when every data race is verified as benign within the CPU budget.
In our evaluation, Iterative Deepening
%with data-race preemption points
found 1.79x as many bugs and verified 4.25x as many tests compared to stateless model checking without data-race preemption points.
%Our evaluation shows this technique is
%more effective than single-state-space model checking
%%both at finding more bugs and at completing more state spaces when no bug exists.
%both at finding the same bugs faster and at finding new bugs entirely.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%We are great. Accept our paper.

We have presented Iterative Deepening and \quicksand, a new technique and tool for automating the choice of preemption points (PPs) during stateless model checking.
% , and \quicksand, a tool which implements this technique tailored to the \landslide~model checker.
\quicksand~incorporates data-race analysis to create new PPs tailored specifically to the program under test,
and manages multiple model checker instances to test many different PP subsets in a given CPU budget, even when the full state space of all PPs would be computationally intractable.

Our evaluation shows that \quicksand~achieves better bug-finding results than either single-pass data-race detection or single-state-space model checking alone.
%We dramatically reduce false-positive data race reports,
%%by verifying the absence of bugs in their associated state spaces
%and find bugs caused by nondeterministic data-races in alternate thread interleavings missed entirely by single-pass analysis.
%Compared to prior work,
%, we find bugs faster in smaller subset state spaces, %% not true, or at least, not by very much
%when the maximal state space is too large to explore
We find new bugs with data-race PPs that could not be exposed by preempting only on synchronization APIs.
Moreover, when all data-race PPs can be fully tested within the CPU budget, we provide a verification as strong as if every single instruction had been used as a PP.

%Although \landslide~itself is not publicly available due to its dependency on the non-free simulator \simics, \quicksand~is open-source and its interface can be adapted to fit any similar tool.
